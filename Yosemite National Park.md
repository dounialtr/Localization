&nbsp;

<p align=justify> The jewel in the crown of California’s national parks, Yosemite National Park has been stunning visitors since the first two travelers laid eyes on it in 1855. Now, every year over 4 million people stand in awe of its unique natural treasures, which have been documented by everyone from early conservationist John Muir to legendary photographer Ansel Adams. Carved into the center of the Sierra Nevada Mountains by ancient geological forces, Yosemite’s splendor and biodiversity are so grand that it was even designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984. </p>

## Breathtaking Nature in Yosemite National Park 

<p align=justify> Established in 1864, Yosemite National Park in California wows with more than 3,000 square kilometers of thundering waterfalls, deep valleys, towering giant sequoias and incredible granite peaks. </p> 

&nbsp;

The park — located about 260 kilometers east of San Francisco — is full of iconic landmarks. Marvel at the daring slopes of Half Dome, Yosemite’s nearly 2,700-meter trademark peak, and El Capitan, the largest single granite rock on Earth. Both sites lure rock climbers in droves (you’ll need to submit your name to a lottery if you’re hoping to climb Half Dome). If rock climbing isn’t on your to-do list, venture deeper into the park and visit the magnificent Yosemite Falls, the highest on the continent at nearly 740 meters. Or enjoy a relaxing stroll through Mariposa Grove, shaded by sequoia trees so tall that you can’t see the tops.

## Climbing El Capitan in Yosemite National Park
<p align=justify> The pair had expected to climb in near obscurity. "We weren't even thinking about who was going to care. That was the last thing on our mind," says Jorgeson. But the ascent, which took 19 days, gained a following on social media. Jorgeson's Instagram following exploded, and news outlets from The New York Times to NBC took notice. "I think the fact that it played out over the course of two weeks was probably a pretty important thing," he says. "One headline for one accomplishment is pretty easy to forget, but when you get to follow a journey through two weeks in an iconic area like Yosemite at a time when the world is full of bad news, I think it just hit all of these notes that people needed." </p>
