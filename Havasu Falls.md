# Havasu Falls in Arizona

## A GUIDE TO VISITING HAVASU FALLS THE 'RIGHT WAY'
&nbsp;

 <p align=justify> The magic of Havasu Falls may be hard to define—is it the turquoise pools or its remote location?—but it's undeniable that people come from all over to witness their beauty. Getting there, though, is not as easy as booking a ticket.
To visit Havasu Falls "the right way" requires planning and plenty of physical preparation. Here's our guide to make your trip to the falls a memorable one. </p> 
 
 &nbsp;
 
## But first, the basics 
 
<p align=justify> The official season runs from February - November. The earlier months mean colder waters but possibly fewer crowds. During the summer, from June to August, the trail is subject to close due to flooding and extreme heat (above 115°F / 46°C). </p> 
 
<p align=justify> Havasu Falls sits on the Havasupai Indian Reservation—which is not part of Grand Canyon National Park—so you'll need to buy a permit from the Havasupai Tribe to access the area. That is if you're among the lucky few able to score a reservation when the season's dates go live on February 1 at 8 a.m. (MST). </p>

## Where to stay
 
 
 <p align=justify> The campground is an area spanning a mile on both sides of Havasu Creek between Havasu Falls and nearby Mooney Falls. There are no assigned sites; meaning, once you arrive, you're welcome to set up camp wherever you like within the designated area. </p> 
 

<p align=justify>To make a campground reservation, visit Havasupai Reservations website before February and create an account. (You cannot obtain permits or make reservations for the campground via phone.) You'll thank us later when the site goes live and you're not messing with logins, especially since reservations can sell out within minutes. Having an account lets you check the cancellation/transfer page for dates that reopen later in the year. </p>
